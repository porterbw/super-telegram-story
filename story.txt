This is the story of Toledo Jimmy. Toledo Jimmy liked wine, long walks on the
beach, and German techno. He also had a super telegraph that sent super 
telegrams, whcih allowed him to communicate with the dead. Using this 
extraordinary power he was able to start in his own reality television show
where he moderated arguments between people and their deceased relatives.

Toledo Jimmy quickly found widespread fame and success in the television 
industry. He soon rose to the heights of Dr. Phil, and dare I say, Oprah
herself. Despite having no qualifications outside of owning a super telegraph,
Toledo Jimmy found himself as a leading candidate for the 2032 Presidential
Election.
