This is the story of Toledo Jimmy. Toledo Jimmy liked wine, long walks on the
beach, and German techno. He also had a super telegraph that sent super 
telegrams, whcih allowed him to communicate with the dead. Using this 
extraordinary power he was able to start in his own reality television show
where he moderated arguments between people and their deceased relatives.

Toledo Jimmy quickly found widespread fame and success in the television 
industry. He soon rose to the heights of Dr. Phil, and dare I say, Oprah
herself. Despite having no qualifications outside of owning a super telegraph,
Toledo Jimmy found himself as a leading candidate for the 2032 Presidential
Election.

Because of Toledo Jimmy's rapid rise to fame, power, and fortune, all of his
success started going to his head. At some point, Toledo shifted from using
his power for good to share the knowledge of past generations, to actually 
lying about what deceased individuals shared with him for personal gain. This
came to head when he shared with the public his "conversations" with 
Abraham Lincoln while on the campaign trail.

He claimed that Abraham Lincoln told him that the future of the United States 
was a godless one and that the key to saving the country was to abolish taxes 
completely and rely on the goodwill of the citizens to keep up infrastructure,
education, and public health. Though this platform took him far, when the truth 
about his conversations with Lincoln surfaced Toledo was discredited. In reality 
Lincoln spent many hours of his talks with Toledo reminiscing about his cat Tarzan
Timmy.
